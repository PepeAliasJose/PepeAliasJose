# PepeAliasJose

👋 Hi, I’m Pepe, I’m interested in Java, JavaScript, Python, Tensorflow and Robotics.
I've been in contact with technology since I was 8 with an old single-core Linux computer with 512 MB of RAM,
now I’m currently learning C and C++. [Porfolio](https://pepercfoundry.web.app/)

At an industrial system's heart, a Jetson Nano module increases its functionality. SELENE III is improved to be a full AI program with real-time object detection.

SELENE III manages the installation's workflow, controlling the conveyor belts' speeds and guiding the robotic arm. SELENE III also includes a protection system that stops the installation and sends an alert message in the presence of a person if the installation is on.

- Python 3
- Tensorflow
